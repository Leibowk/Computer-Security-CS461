The core problem that we learned from this assignment from the description was that "You should never allow users to create a file on your system that is callable and then allow them to call that file."

From this we can see one solution would be to not allow the rights of the users to create a file. This however is slightly more problematic, because for example, we want them to be creating an account or uploading a file.

A better solution is that you could allow them to make files, but then only allowing certain files in the system to be accessable. So even if I made a file, it isn't as bad if I can't access the location that it goes to.
